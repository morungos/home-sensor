# A home sensor

* A temperature and humidity sensor (HDC1080)
* A small OLED display (SH1106)
* A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, with wireless

The aim is to have a more complete sensor, including air
quality, and one which will report via MQTT to a local Home Assistant 
or similar. 

The code is written using the Pico SDK, C/C++, and cmake.
